# Steal-the-Bird
Steal the Bird is a hectic and fast-paced multiplayer game about stealing a bird and murdering thousands more. (Who needs birds anyway?)

To begin, players explore a world together picking up weapons and items. A few birds fly-by and the players must hide from these birds or kill them and hope they are not spotted.

Once the players find the bird they must steal it and battle hundreds of little birds swarming around them.

Kill the birds with guns, explosions, swords, or bigger explosions!

The level is completed once the bird has successfully been stolen and is far from the bird camp/city (nest?).
